If you are a fan of the classic football management game Championship Manager 2001/2002, you might have heard of the Diablo Tactic. This is a tactic that can make your team score goals for fun and win almost every match. But what is the Diablo Tactic and how can you use it in your game?
 
The Diablo Tactic is a 4-1-3-2 formation that exploits a flaw in the game's match engine. It involves using three attacking midfielders who have high pace, dribbling, passing and creativity attributes, and two strikers who have high finishing, off the ball and composure attributes. The tactic also requires a defensive midfielder who can break up the opposition's attacks and distribute the ball to the front players.

The idea behind the Diablo Tactic is to overload the central area of the pitch and create numerical superiority against the opposition's defence. The attacking midfielders will run with the ball, pass it around or shoot from distance, while the strikers will make runs behind the defence and finish off any chances. The tactic also relies on a high defensive line and pressing to prevent the opposition from building up play.
 
The Diablo Tactic is not an official tactic that comes with the game, but a custom tactic that was created by some players and shared online. You can download it from various websites, such as [this one](https://www.champman0102.net/viewtopic.php?t=1014). To use it in your game, you need to extract the tactic file to your tactics folder in your game directory, and then load it in your game.
 
However, be warned that the Diablo Tactic is not a magic bullet that will guarantee success. It still depends on your players' attributes, morale, fitness and form. It also depends on your opponents' tactics, strengths and weaknesses. The Diablo Tactic can be countered by some formations, such as a 5-3-2 or a 4-5-1, that can match or outnumber your midfielders and defenders. The tactic can also backfire if your players are not disciplined enough or if you concede early goals.
 
Therefore, it is advisable to use the Diablo Tactic with caution and moderation. Do not rely on it too much or use it in every match. Be flexible and adapt to different situations and opponents. The Diablo Tactic can be a powerful weapon in your arsenal, but it can also be a double-edged sword if used incorrectly.
  
If you want to try the Diablo Tactic in your game, here are some tips and tricks that can help you get the best out of it:
 
- Choose the right players for each position. Look for players who have high attributes that suit their roles, such as pace, dribbling, passing and creativity for the attacking midfielders, and finishing, off the ball and composure for the strikers. You can also use filters or scouts to find suitable players.
- Train your players to improve their attributes and familiarity with the tactic. You can use the training schedules that come with the tactic file, or create your own. You can also use coaches and tutors to boost your players' skills and personalities.
- Rotate your squad and rest your key players. The Diablo Tactic is a demanding tactic that requires a lot of stamina and concentration from your players. You should avoid playing the same players in every match, as they will get tired and lose form. You should also rest your players before important matches or when they have low fitness or morale.
- Adjust your team instructions and individual orders according to the match situation and opponent. You can tweak some settings in the tactic screen, such as mentality, passing style, tempo, width, pressing and offside trap. You can also give specific orders to your players, such as marking, tackling, running with ball and shooting. You should be flexible and adapt to different scenarios and challenges.
- Watch the match highlights and analyze the statistics. You can use the match screen to see how your team is performing and where you need to improve. You can watch the highlights to see how your players are executing the tactic and where they are creating or conceding chances. You can also check the statistics to see how many shots, passes, tackles, fouls and offsides you have made or faced.

By following these tips and tricks, you can maximize the potential of the Diablo Tactic and dominate Championship Manager 2001/2002. However, remember that the Diablo Tactic is not a cheat or a guarantee of success. It is a tool that can help you achieve your goals, but it still depends on your skills and decisions as a manager. The Diablo Tactic can make you a legend, but it can also make you a laughing stock if used wrongly.
