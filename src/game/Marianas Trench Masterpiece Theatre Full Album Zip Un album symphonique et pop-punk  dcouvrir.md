Masterpiece Theatre is a concept album that revolves around three songs: Masterpiece Theatre I, II and III. These songs are musical collages that incorporate elements from all the other songs on the album, creating a cohesive and theatrical experience. The album also features five singles: Cross My Heart, All to Myself, Beside You, Celebrity Status and Good to You. Each single has its own style and mood, ranging from upbeat and catchy to emotional and romantic.
 
The album is a slight departure from Fix Me, containing more symphonic elements and instruments while still retaining the punk rock influence of its predecessor. The songs Masterpiece Theatre (I, II and III), Beside You and Good To You show some experimentation using pianos, strings and harmonies. The album also showcases the vocal range and skills of lead singer Josh Ramsay, who wrote and produced most of the songs on the album.
