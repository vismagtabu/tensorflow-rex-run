The sound engine of Novation V-Station VSTi V1.6 is based on Novation's Liquid Analog synthesis, which aims to emulate the warmth and character of analog circuits using digital technology. The plug-in features three oscillators per voice, each with six waveforms (sine, triangle, sawtooth, square, pulse and double saw), pulse-width modulation, sync and FM capability. You can also mix in a noise generator and two ring modulators for more complex and metallic sounds. The filter section offers a 12dB/octave low-pass filter with resonance, cutoff and envelope controls, as well as a high-pass filter for removing unwanted low frequencies. The filter can be modulated by an LFO, an envelope or the keyboard tracking.
  
The plug-in also has a powerful arpeggiator with sync-lock feature, which allows you to play rhythmic patterns in sync with an incoming MIDI clock. You can choose from 32 different patterns, adjust the octave range, gate time and swing amount, and transpose the arpeggio using the keyboard. The effects section offers five high-quality effects that can be applied simultaneously: reverb, chorus, phaser, delay and distortion. You can adjust the parameters of each effect using dedicated knobs and switches. The plug-in also has an EQ filter for shaping the overall tone of the sound.
  
## Novation V-Station VSTi V1.6: User Interface and Performance
  
Novation V-Station VSTi V1.6 has a user-friendly and intuitive interface that resembles the hardware K-Station. The plug-in has four main pages: Oscillator/Filter, Envelope/LFO/Arpeggiator, Effects/EQ and Global/MIDI. You can switch between them using the buttons at the top of the plug-in window. Each page has a clear layout of knobs, sliders and switches that control the various parameters of the sound engine. You can also access some hidden functions by right-clicking on some controls or using keyboard shortcuts.
  
The plug-in supports MIDI learn function, which allows you to assign any parameter to any MIDI controller by simply clicking on it and moving the controller. You can also save and load your MIDI assignments using presets. The plug-in comes with 200 factory presets that cover a wide range of sounds, from basses and leads to pads and pianos. You can also create your own presets and store them in 400 user slots. You can browse through the presets using the arrows or the drop-down menu at the bottom of the plug-in window.
  
Novation V-Station VSTi V1.6 is compatible with Windows 98SE or higher (as a VST instrument only) and Mac OS X 10.2 or higher (as an Audio Units instrument only). You need a host sequencer that supports VST or Audio Units plug-ins to use it. The plug-in has low CPU usage and latency, making it suitable for both studio and live performance. You can run multiple instances of the plug-in in your project without any problems.
