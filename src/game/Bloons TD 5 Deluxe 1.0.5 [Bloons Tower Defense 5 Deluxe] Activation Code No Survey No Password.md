## Bloons TD 5 Deluxe 1.0.5 Tips and Tricks

1. Place towers strategically. Don't just place towers randomly on the track. Think about their characteristics, range, and abilities. For example, place Ninja Monkeys and Tack Shooters in corners to hit multiple bloons at once, place Ice Towers and Glue Gunners in high-traffic areas to slow down bloons, and place cannons near metal-coated bloons to break their armor [^1^] [^3^].
2. Use different towers. Don't rely on just one type of tower to pop all the bloons. There are different types of bloons that require different towers to defeat. For example, you need Ninja Monkeys or Monkey Villages to detect camouflaged bloons, you need Monkey Apprentices or Monkey Aces to pop lead bloons, and you need Super Monkeys or Sun Gods to pop MOAB-class bloons [^1^] [^2^].
3. Claim the daily rewards. Every day, you can log into the game and claim your reward from the giant treasure box. You can get money, special monkeys, items, and more. You can use the money to buy specialty buildings that can give you different advantages in the game [^1^].
4. Set up kill zones. Kill zones are areas on the track where most bloons will get wiped out. These are best placed in tight turns or intersections where the bloons will bottleneck. You can set up large radius attacks in these kill zones, such as Bomb Towers, Mortar Towers, Bloonchippers, or Monkey Aces [^1^] [^3^].
5. Use special agents and abilities. Special agents are powerful monkeys that can help you pop more bloons. You can buy them with Monkey Money or earn them from daily rewards. Some of the special agents are Watermelon Spitter, Monkey Farmer, and Mad Snowman. Abilities are special powers that you can activate once they are charged up. Some of the abilities are Super Monkey Storm, Summon Phoenix, and Blade Maelstrom [^2^].
