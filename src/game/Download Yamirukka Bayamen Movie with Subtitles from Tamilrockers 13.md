 Here is what I continued:  
Yamirukka Bayamen movie has a simple plot but a gripping screenplay. The film starts with a flashback where a couple is killed by a ghost in a bungalow. The story then shifts to the present day where four friends, Sharath (Krishna), Sowmya (Rupa Manjari), Balaji (Karunakaran) and Kavitha (Oviya) decide to rent the same bungalow for a vacation. They are unaware of the haunted history of the place and soon start experiencing strange and scary incidents.
 
They also meet a mysterious caretaker (Mayilsamy) who warns them about the ghost. They soon realize that they are trapped in the bungalow and have to find a way to escape. They also discover that one of them has a connection with the ghost and the reason behind its vengeance. How they deal with the ghost and its secrets forms the rest of the story.
 
Yamirukka Bayamen movie is a refreshing take on the horror comedy genre. The film does not rely on cheap jump scares or gore but rather on situational comedy and witty dialogues. The film also has some emotional moments that add depth to the characters and the story. The film is well-paced and does not drag at any point.
 
The film also boasts of some excellent performances by the cast. Krishna as Sharath is convincing as the leader of the group and the love interest of Sowmya. He has good comic timing and chemistry with Rupa Manjari. Rupa Manjari as Sowmya is adorable as the innocent and sweet girl who has a crush on Sharath. She also delivers some hilarious expressions and reactions.
