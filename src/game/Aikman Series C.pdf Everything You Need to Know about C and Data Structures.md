
 According to [^5^], SEO friendly HTML code optimization involves:  - Providing unique titles and meta descriptions for each web page - Writing code for users, not for search engines - Using relevant and descriptive hyperlinks - Using breadcrumbs to show the hierarchy of your website - Using heading tags to structure your content - Using alt attributes to describe your images - Using schema markup to provide additional information to search engines  According to [^6^], meta tags are snippets of code that tell search engines important information about your web page, such as how they should display it in search results. They also tell web browsers how to display it to visitors. Some of the most important meta tags for SEO are:  - Meta title: This is the page title that Google and most other search engines show in search results. It should be unique, descriptive, concise, and click-worthy. - Meta description: This is the snippet of text that appears below the title in search results. It should summarize the content of the page and entice users to click on it. - Meta robots: This tells search engines whether to index and follow your page or not. You can also use it to control other aspects of crawling and indexing, such as canonicalization, pagination, and noarchive. - Meta refresh redirect: This tells web browsers to automatically refresh and redirect your page to another URL after a specified number of seconds. However, this is not recommended for SEO, as it can confuse users and search engines. You should use a 301 redirect instead. - Meta charset: This specifies the character encoding of your web page. It should be set to UTF-8 for compatibility and security reasons. - Meta viewport: This tells web browsers how to adjust the size and scale of your web page on different devices. It is essential for responsive web design.  If you are using WordPress, you can install an SEO plugin like Yoast or Rank Math to help you create and edit these meta tags easily. Other CMS platforms may have similar functionality built-in or available as extensions.
