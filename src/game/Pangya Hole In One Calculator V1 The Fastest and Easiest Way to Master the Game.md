## How to Use Pangya Hole In One Calculator V1?
 
To use Pangya Hole In One Calculator V1, you need to download it from SoundCloud[^2^] or from the Xiaomi Community[^1^], where it was also posted. After downloading it, you need to unzip it and run the executable file. You will see a white box with six squares long and six squares wide. Each square represents one-tenth of a tile in Pangya. You can use this box to measure the distance and angle of your shots.
 
To calculate your shots, you need to fill in the five fields below the box: number of holes (N), number of steps (S), number of chips (C), number of holes to be completed at one point (H), and point at which all holes are to be played (P). For example, if you want to do a chip in shot with two holes and two steps, you need to enter N=2, S=2, C=1, H=1, P=0. The calculator will then show you the power (PW), angle (AN), spin (SP) and curve (CV) of your shot. You can also see the formula used by the calculator below the fields.
 
To adjust the number of steps for each hole, you can use the plus (+) and minus (-) buttons below the box. For example, if you want to increase the number of steps for the first hole by one, you need to press + once. If you want to decrease the number of steps for the second hole by two, you need to press - twice. The calculator will automatically update the power, angle, spin and curve of your shot accordingly.
