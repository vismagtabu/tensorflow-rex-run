# Ghazwa E Badar: The First and Most Important Battle of Islam
 
Ghazwa E Badar was the first military encounter between the Muslims and the Quraish of Makkah, who were the enemies of Islam. It took place on 17 Ramadan, 2 AH (13 March, 624 CE) at a place called Badar, about 80 miles from Madinah. It was a decisive victory for the Muslims, who were outnumbered and outmatched by the Quraish in terms of weapons and resources. In this article, we will explore the history, significance, and lessons of Ghazwa E Badar in Urdu.
 
## History of Ghazwa E Badar
 
The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) faced severe opposition and persecution from the Quraish of Makkah, who rejected his message of monotheism and worship of Allah. The Prophet (SAW) and his followers migrated from Makkah to Madinah in 622 CE, an event known as Hijra. However, the Quraish did not leave them alone and continued to harass and attack them. They also confiscated their properties and belongings in Makkah.

One of the leaders of the Quraish, Abu Sufyan, was returning from Syria with a rich caravan of goods. The Prophet (SAW) decided to intercept the caravan as a way of compensating for their losses and weakening their enemy. He gathered around 313 companions and set out for Badar, where the caravan was expected to pass. However, Abu Sufyan got wind of the plan and changed his route. He also sent a message to Makkah, asking for reinforcements.
 
The Quraish responded by sending a large army of about 1000 men, led by Abu Jahl, who was one of the most arrogant and hostile enemies of Islam. They wanted to crush the Muslims once and for all. The Prophet (SAW) consulted his companions whether they should proceed with the battle or retreat. They unanimously agreed to fight in the way of Allah, even though they were vastly outnumbered and ill-equipped.
 
## Significance of Ghazwa E Badar
 
Ghazwa E Badar was a crucial battle for the survival and success of Islam. It was also a test of faith and courage for the Muslims. The battle began with a duel between three champions from each side. The Muslims, led by Hazrat Ali (RA), killed their opponents swiftly. Then, the two armies clashed in a fierce combat.
 
The Muslims fought bravely and passionately, relying on Allah's help and guidance. Allah sent angels to assist them in the battle, as mentioned in the Quran: "And already had Allah given you victory at [the battle of] Badr while you were few in number. Then fear Allah; perhaps you will be grateful." (Quran 3:123)
 
The Quraish were defeated and fled in panic. Many of their leaders and warriors were killed or captured, including Abu Jahl, who was slain by two young Ansari boys. The Muslims suffered only 14 martyrs, while the Quraish lost 70 men and had 70 prisoners. The Muslims also seized their weapons and spoils of war.
 
Ghazwa E Badar was a clear sign of Allah's favor and support for His Messenger (SAW) and His religion. It boosted the morale and confidence of the Muslims and increased their reputation among other tribes. It also proved that Allah grants victory to those who are sincere, steadfast, and obedient to Him.
