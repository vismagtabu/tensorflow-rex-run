Sanda Marin was the pen name of Cecilia Simionescu, a journalist and writer who was born in 1900 and died in 1961. She was one of the most influential figures in Romanian gastronomy, and her cookbook is considered a national treasure. She collected recipes from various sources, such as magazines, newspapers, friends, family, and her own experiments. She also adapted recipes from other cuisines, such as French, Italian, German, Hungarian, Turkish, and Greek, to suit the Romanian palate and ingredients.
 
The cookbook is divided into four volumes: Buna Menajera sau Carte de Bucate (Good Housewife or Cookbook), Carte de Bucate (Cookbook), Carte de Bucate pentru Tinerele Gospodine (Cookbook for Young Housewives), and Carte de Bucate pentru Sarbatori (Cookbook for Holidays). Each volume has its own table of contents and index, and the recipes are organized by categories, such as soups, salads, meat dishes, fish dishes, vegetable dishes, pastries, cakes, preserves, drinks, etc. The recipes are written in a clear and concise style, with measurements in grams and liters. Some recipes also have illustrations or photos to show the final result or the steps involved.

Some of the most popular Romanian dishes that can be found in Sanda Marin's cookbook are:
 
- Sarmale (cabbage rolls) - considered to be Romania's national dish, these stuffed cabbage rolls are actually of Turkish origins, but the Romanians claim that theirs are the best. The stuffing consists of a balanced mixture of rice and minced meat (usually pork or pork combined with beef) and other vegetables and local herbs. The rolls are cooked in clay pots in the oven, covered with some water, some cabbage brine for sourness, and some slices of traditional bacon for a tasty smoky touch. They are traditionally served with mamaliga (polenta) and sour cream. [^5^]
- Ciorba de burta (tripe soup) - this traditional soup has a very strong aroma and a velvety texture which is the result of several hours of work. Besides the beef tripe, this dish also uses beef and pork legs which are boiled for several hours in order to obtain the delicious soup. The soup is seasoned with garlic, vinegar, salt, pepper, bay leaves, and lovage. It is usually served with sour cream and hot peppers. [^5^]
- Mici (grilled minced meat rolls) - these are small sausages made from a mixture of minced beef, pork, lamb, garlic, spices, and baking soda. They are grilled over charcoal and served with mustard, bread, fries, or salad. They are a popular street food and a must-have at any barbecue party. [^5^]
- Cozonac (sweet bread) - this is a festive dessert that is usually prepared for Christmas and Easter. It is a fluffy yeast dough filled with various ingredients such as walnuts, poppy seeds, cocoa, raisins, Turkish delight, or cheese. It is baked in a loaf pan and sprinkled with powdered sugar. It is best enjoyed with a glass of milk or tea. [^5^]
