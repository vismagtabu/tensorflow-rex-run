# How to Fix the Galaxy Map Bug in Mass Effect with a Crack
 
If you are playing Mass Effect on PC with a cracked version of the game, you may encounter a bug that prevents you from accessing the galaxy map and progressing the story. This bug is caused by a faulty crack that does not work well with the game's DRM protection. Fortunately, there is a way to fix this bug and enjoy the game without any problems.
 
The solution is to download and install a file called ME\_gmfix, which is a modified version of the game's executable that bypasses the DRM check and allows you to use the galaxy map normally. You can find this file on various torrent sites or download it directly from [this link](https://www.cheathappens.com/show_board2.asp?headID=67100&titleID=13879) [^1^]. To use it, simply replace your original MassEffect.exe file with the ME\_gmfix file in your game folder and run the game as usual.

This fix should work for most cases, but if you still have trouble with the galaxy map or other issues, you may need to try some other solutions. For example, some users have reported that rapidly clicking the left and right mouse buttons while trying to access the galaxy map can sometimes make it work [^3^]. Others have suggested using a different crack or patching the game to the latest version.

If you are wondering what causes the galaxy map bug in the first place, the answer is not very clear. Some speculate that it is a deliberate feature of the game's DRM system, designed to prevent piracy and force users to buy the original game. Others think that it is a side effect of the game's anti-debugging code, which interferes with some cracks and causes them to malfunction. Whatever the reason, the bug is very annoying and frustrating for many players who want to experience the game's epic story and gameplay.
