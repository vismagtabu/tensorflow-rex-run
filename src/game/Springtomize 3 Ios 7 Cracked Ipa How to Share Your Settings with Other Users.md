Springtomize 3 is compatible with iOS 7, 8, and 9, and it costs $2.99 on Cydia. However, you can also find a cracked version of it on some third-party repos, such as HackYouriPhone. This version is free, but it may not be updated or supported by the developer. Therefore, we recommend that you purchase the official version if you can afford it.
