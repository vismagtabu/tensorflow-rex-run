## Anno 2205: Tips and Tricks for Beginners
 
Anno 2205 is a complex and challenging game that requires a lot of planning, management, and strategy. If you are new to the game or want to improve your skills, here are some tips and tricks that might help you.
 
### Complete the Sector Projects as soon as possible
 
Sector Projects are special missions that unlock new features, resources, and rewards for your corporation. They also increase your attractiveness and influence in each sector. You should try to complete them as soon as possible, as they will make your life easier and more profitable in the long run. To start a Sector Project, you need to build a Spaceport in the sector and then click on the project icon on the top right of the screen.
 
### Don't stack your money
 
Money is important in Anno 2205, but it is not everything. You should always invest your money in expanding your corporation, buying new sectors, upgrading your buildings, and researching new technologies. Money that is sitting idle in your account is not doing anything for you. You can also use your money to buy shares of other corporations, which will give you a passive income and increase your influence.
 
### Use keyboard shortcuts
 
Anno 2205 has a lot of keyboard shortcuts that can make your gameplay faster and smoother. For example, you can use Tab to switch between your command ship and your space station, F11 to toggle the day/night cycle, F1 to F4 to switch between regions, and Ctrl+Z to undo your last action. You can also use the arrow keys to rotate buildings and modules before placing them. You can check the full list of keyboard shortcuts in the game settings.
 
### Optimize your production chains
 
Production chains are the backbone of your economy in Anno 2205. They are the processes that transform raw materials into finished goods that satisfy the needs of your population and generate income. You should always try to optimize your production chains by making sure they are balanced, efficient, and sustainable. Some ways to do that are:

- Use modules to increase the output or reduce the input of your factories.
- Use transfer routes to transport goods between sectors and regions.
- Use warehouses to store excess goods and avoid bottlenecks.
- Use trade routes to buy or sell goods on the global market.
- Use energy transmitters to supply power from one sector to another.

### Have fun!
 
Anno 2205 is a game that offers a lot of freedom and creativity for players. You can build your cities however you like, explore different environments, engage in combat missions, and customize your corporation. There is no right or wrong way to play the game, as long as you enjoy it. So have fun and experiment with different strategies and styles!
