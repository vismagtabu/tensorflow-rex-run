Expert Choice 11 is a user-friendly software that allows you to create and edit decision models using AHP. You can start by creating a new model and defining your goal, criteria, and alternatives. You can also import data from Excel or other sources to populate your model. Expert Choice 11 will guide you through the steps of entering your judgments, synthesizing your results, and performing sensitivity analysis.
 
One of the main features of Expert Choice 11 is the ability to compare your criteria and alternatives using pairwise comparisons. Pairwise comparisons are a simple and intuitive way of expressing your preferences using a scale from 1 to 9. For example, if you think that criterion A is moderately more important than criterion B, you can assign a value of 3 to A over B. Expert Choice 11 will automatically calculate the reciprocal value for B over A. You can also use verbal judgments such as equal, slightly more, much more, etc.
 
Another feature of Expert Choice 11 is the ability to generate graphs and reports that show your decision outcomes and trade-offs. You can use different types of graphs such as pie charts, bar charts, spider charts, etc. to visualize your results. You can also use sensitivity analysis to see how your results change when you vary the weights of your criteria or the ratings of your alternatives. You can export your graphs and reports to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or PDF formats.
