## Step 3: Create and Upload Image
 
The third step is to create and upload an image of the operating system and applications that you want to boot from the server. To do this, you will need another computer that has the same hardware specifications as your client computers. On this computer, install Windows XP or Windows 7 as your preferred operating system and any applications that you want to use on your diskless clients.
 
After installing and configuring everything on this computer, run OBM Diskless Client from the Start menu or desktop shortcut. This will launch a wizard that will guide you through the process of creating an image of your system. You will need to choose a name for your image, select the partitions to include in the image, and specify some settings such as compression level, encryption password, etc.
 
When the wizard is done, it will ask you to reboot your computer. Do not reboot yet. Instead, go back to your server computer and run OBM Diskless Server from the Start menu or desktop shortcut. This will launch another wizard that will help you upload your image to the server. You will need to choose a name for your image group, select the image file that you created on your client computer, and specify some settings such as cache size, write back mode, etc.
 
When the wizard is done, it will start uploading your image to the server. This may take some time depending on the size of your image and the speed of your network connection. When the upload is complete, you can reboot your client computer and remove any hard disks or CD-ROMs from it.
 
## Step 4: Boot Client Computers from Server
 
The final step is to boot your client computers from the server using OBM Diskless. To do this, make sure that your client computers are connected to the same network as your server computer and that they are configured to boot from LAN or PXE in their BIOS settings.
 
When you turn on your client computers, they will automatically detect the OBM Diskless server and display a menu of available images to boot from. Choose the image group that you created in step 3 and press Enter. Your client computers will then load the image from
