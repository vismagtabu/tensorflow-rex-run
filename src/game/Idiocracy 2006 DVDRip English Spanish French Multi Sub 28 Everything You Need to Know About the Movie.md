The film follows Joe Bauers, a U.S. Army librarian who is selected for a government hibernation experiment as the "most average individual" in the entire military. He is paired with Rita, a sex worker hired by the military. However, the experiment is forgotten when the officer in charge is arrested for running a prostitution ring. Joe and Rita wake up 500 years later in a society where corporations run everything, people are addicted to consumerism and entertainment, and everyone is incredibly stupid.
 
Joe soon realizes that he is the smartest person alive and tries to find a way to go back to his own time. Along the way, he meets Frito, a lawyer who agrees to help him for money; President Camacho, a former porn star and wrestler who appoints Joe as his Secretary of the Interior; and other colorful characters who represent the idiocy of the future. Joe also tries to reconnect with Rita, who has become a successful businesswoman by exploiting her clients' stupidity.
 
Idiocracy 2006 is a satire that mocks various aspects of American culture, such as anti-intellectualism, capitalism, commercialism, consumerism, corporatocracy, and media.

Idiocracy 2006 is not only a comedy, but also a warning. The film shows how human civilization can deteriorate if people stop using their brains and rely on technology and corporations to make decisions for them.
