# How to Use REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE to Create Stunning Slow Motion Effects
 
REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE is a powerful plugin that allows you to manipulate the speed and timing of your video clips in Adobe After Effects. With Twixtor Pro, you can create smooth and realistic slow motion effects, even with footage that was not shot at high frame rates. Twixtor Pro uses advanced optical flow and motion estimation algorithms to track the movement of pixels across frames, and interpolate new frames to fill in the gaps. This way, you can slow down or speed up your video without losing quality or introducing artifacts.

In this article, we will show you how to use REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE to create stunning slow motion effects in a few simple steps. You will need Adobe After Effects CS6 or later, and a valid serial key and keygen to activate the plugin.
 
## Step 1: Install REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE
 
To install REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE, you need to download the plugin from the official website or from a trusted source. Make sure you download the version that matches your operating system and After Effects version. Once you have downloaded the plugin, run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You will need to enter your serial key and keygen when prompted to activate the plugin.
 
## Step 2: Import Your Video Clip
 
Once you have installed REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE, you can start using it in After Effects. To import your video clip, go to File > Import > File and select the video file you want to edit. You can also drag and drop the file into the Project panel. After importing your video clip, create a new composition by dragging the clip onto the New Composition button at the bottom of the Project panel.
 
## Step 3: Apply REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE
 
To apply REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE, select your video layer in the Timeline panel and go to Effect > RE:Vision Effects > Twixtor Pro. This will open the Effect Controls panel, where you can adjust the settings of the plugin.
 
The most important setting is the Speed parameter, which determines how much you want to slow down or speed up your video clip. By default, it is set to 100%, which means no change in speed. To create a slow motion effect, lower the Speed value to a percentage below 100%. For example, if you set it to 50%, your video clip will play at half speed.
 
You can also use keyframes to animate the Speed parameter over time, creating variable speed effects. To do this, move the Current Time Indicator (CTI) to where you want to start or end the speed change, and click on the stopwatch icon next to the Speed parameter to create a keyframe. Then move the CTI to another point in time and change the Speed value to create another keyframe.

## Step 4: Fine-Tune Your Slow Motion Effect
 
After applying REVisionFX Twixtor Pro 6.1.0 for AE and adjusting the Speed parameter, you may notice some artifacts or glitches in your slow motion effect, especially if your original footage was not shot at a high frame rate or has fast or complex motion. To fix these issues, you can fine-tune your slow motion effect using some of the other settings in the Effect Controls panel.
 
One of the most useful settings is the Frame Interpolation parameter, which determines how Twixtor Pro interpolates new frames between existing frames. By default, it is set to Motion Weighted Blend, which blends pixels from neighboring frames based on their motion vectors. This mode works well for most cases, but it may cause some ghosting or blurring effects if there is too much motion or occlusion in your footage.
 
To reduce these artifacts, you can try changing the Frame Interpolation mode to Smart Blend, which uses a more sophisticated algorithm that analyzes pixel colors and edges to create more accurate new frames. However, this mode may also introduce some noise or flickering effects if there is not enough detail or contrast in your footage
